2) Using IMDB Weighted Average formular: This approach applies the IMDB formular and presents the top 10 movies
3) Using TF-IDF Vectorizer to find the cosine similarity of the movie plot to make movie recommendations
4) Using the Count Vectorizer to determine the cosine similariyy of a movie's cast, keywords, director, genres to make recommendations.
